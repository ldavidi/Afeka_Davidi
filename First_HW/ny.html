                <p>
                    Central Park is a large green park in the middle of New York City.
                    It has lakes, trees, walking paths and open fields where people relax,
                    play and enjoy nature inside the city.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you walk in the park, you can see the tall buildings around you,
                    but still feel calm and surrounded by nature.
                </p>
