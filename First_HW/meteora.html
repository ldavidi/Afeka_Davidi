                    Meteora is an area with huge rock pillars, and old monasteries built on top of them.
                    The view of the cliffs and the buildings is very unique and dramatic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Standing there and looking down from the viewpoints gives a feeling
                    of height, open space, and ancient history mixed with nature.
                </p>
